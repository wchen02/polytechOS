<TITLE>CS3224 Project: Process Scheduling</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY>
<H1>Project 1: Process Scheduling</H1>
<H2>Focus</H2>
<P>Simulate various process scheduling algorithms.</P>
<H2>Note</H2>
<P>There are only two algorithms for this assignment: FCFS and SRTN with aging.</P>
<H2>Task</H2>
<P>Read in the resource file which provides settings 
  for the necessary parameters, including the name of a file that describes the 
  processes to be scheduled. The resource file will be named "scheduling.txt" by default. You may,if you like, provide the ability to override that with a command line argument. Command line arguments are not required, but using them would make it easier for you to run with different configuration files.</P>
<P>Run each of the required scheduling algorithms, sending the output to standard 
  output.</P>
<P>Your program should not need any other input from the keyboard/user.</P>
<H2>Process File</H2>
<P>The file of processes will consist of a number of lines, each describing a 
  single process. Each line will consist of four fields: Process ID, Arrival Time, 
  Total CPU time required, Acerage CPU burst, as in the following table:</P>

<P>No, the process file will not have any headings, only a single line for each 
  process, with the fields separated by "whitespace". (<A href="https://blackboard.poly.edu/courses/1/Spring1102.CS3224.1484/content/_268941_1/processes.txt">Sample</A> 
  process file)</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Arrival Time:</STRONG> The time that the request is initially made 
    to run the process. Obviously, it is not possible for the process to start 
    running before this time.</LI>
  <LI><STRONG>Total CPU:</STRONG> The total time that the process will need to 
    use the CPU.</LI>
  <LI><STRONG>Average CPU Burst:</STRONG> 
    <UL>
      <LI>We can't <EM>really</EM> know in advance how long a cpu burst will be. 
        For the purpose of this simulation, I am giving you a <EM>average</EM> 
        length for each process's cpu burst.  </LI>
      <LI>At each clock tick, you will query the process as to whether it is finished with its burst. The process will respond true/false, based on a <EM>probabilty distribution.</EM> We will use an even distribution, that is there will be an equal likelihood that any of the three burst values {average-1, average, average+1} will terminate the process's burst.
        <UL>
          <LI>A file of random numbers has been provided 
            for computing the bursts.</LI>
          <LI> Write a function <CODE>random()</CODE> that each time it is called 
            returns the next number in the file. If you run out of numbers, then 
            start from the beginning. </LI>
        </UL>
      </LI>
      <LI>Preemptive algorithms, such as SRTN, may interrupt a process 
        before the current burst is complete. Such an interruption does <EM>not</EM> terminate 
        the burst. When the process is resumed, it will be <EM>continuing</EM> 
        with whatever is left of its last burst.</LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
</UL>
<H2>I/O</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>A process can only run as long as its CPU burst, then it has to stop while 
    it's next I/O request is being serviced. </LI>
  <LI>While the process is waiting for the I/O to complete, it is blocked and 
    will be placed on a "Wait Queue".</LI>
  <LI>For your convience, all I/O requests for this simulator will take the same 
    amount of time, which is specified in the resource file.</LI>
  <LI>When the I/O is complete, the process will be placed back on the appropriate 
    "Ready Queue".</LI>
</UL>
<H2>Algorithms</H2>
<UL>
  <LI> FCFS. Schedule the processes in the order in which they become ready. 
    <UL>
      <LI>Non-preemptive </LI>
      <LI>Allow each process to run for its complete burst</LI>
      <LI>When the burst ends, move the process to the wait queue.</LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
  <LI>Shortest Remaining Time Next with Aging. 
    <UL>
      <LI>Premptive. </LI>
      <LI><EM>Predict</EM> the next burst based on the last burst and the history, 
        using the formula:<BR>
        <CODE>prediction = (AgingRatio * lastBurst) + ((1 - AgingRatio) * history)</CODE></LI>
      <LI><CODE>AgingRatio</CODE> is provided in the resource file.</LI>
      <LI>The current prediction becomes the history, next time around.</LI>
      <LI>Note that the prediction is used for the process's relative priority.</LI>
      <LI>If the aging algorithm <EM>predicts</EM> that a process will have a 
        CPU burst of <CODE>initialPrediction</CODE>, then after the process has 
        run for one unit of time, the prediction for the remaining time to the 
        burst will be <CODE>initialPrediction - 1</CODE>. It is the prediction 
        for how much time remains before a process finishes its burst that is 
        used to determine its place in the ready queue and whether or not a ready 
        process should preempt the running process. </LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
</UL>
<P>Note: The <EM>scheduling algorithms</EM> are not aware of how long a process's 
  burst will actually be. They only become aware when a process's burst ends. 
  By keeping all times as integers (except for the <EM>predicted</EM> burst of 
  the aging algorithm), this is easy to manage.</P>
<P>Priority-based preemptive algorithms, such as SRTN and CTSS, <EM>guarantee</EM> 
  that the highest priority process (for SRTN that is the process with the lowest predicted burst) will always be run. To ensure this, during 
  a context switch we will only decide <EM>which</EM> process will run next at 
  the <EM>end</EM> of the <CODE>ContextSwitchDelay</CODE>. (This is done to simplify 
  your implementations.)</P>
<H2>Output<A name="Output"></A></H2>
<P>Your output should show at each time step what events are occuring, i.e. when a process's burst has ended, when it is being moved from one queue to another, etc. I will attempt to have a sample output file ready shortly, but don't wait to see the precise format of the output, get started right away. You can always modify your display routine later.</P>
<H2>Resource File</H2>
<P>This file will always be named: "scheduling.txt". This is a sample 
  of what the file might look like:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <P><CODE>ProcessFile=Processes.txt<BR>
    IOdelay=2<BR>
    ContextSwitchDelay=1</CODE><CODE><BR>
    AgingRatio=.5<BR>
    Debug=true</CODE></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>Use the same parameter names in your own resource file. </LI>
  <LI>Any parameter that your program does not recognize, should be ignored. 
    <UL>
      <LI>You may display a message if you like.</LI>
      <LI>For example, you do not have to handle the parameter <CODE>Debug</CODE>. 
        I generally include one in my programs when I want to generate useful 
        additional output for debugging. It saves the need for commenting out 
        "print statements" used for debugging.</LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
  <LI>Do not assume that the parameters will always be in the order shown above.</LI>
  <LI>The parameters: 
    <UL>
      <LI><CODE>ProcessFile</CODE>: The name of the file idenitfying the processes. 
        The name will not have any whitespace in it.</LI>
      <LI><CODE>ContextSwitchDelay</CODE>: When the scheduler has to switch from 
        one process to another, then there is a delay of <CODE>ContextSwitchDelay</CODE> 
        units. No process is running on the cpu during that time, though I/O will 
        proceed.</LI>
      <LI><CODE>IOdelay</CODE>: When a process's burst ends, it is because the 
        process has initiated some I/O. The process will not be able to continue 
        until the I/O completes, which will take <CODE>IOdelay</CODE> units of 
        time.</LI>
      <LI><CODE>AgingRatio</CODE>: Only applies to Shortest Remaining Time Next 
        with Aging. 
        <UL>
          <LI><CODE>AgingRatio</CODE> is between zero and one (inclusive).</LI>
          <LI>The aging algorithm uses a "weighted average" of the most 
            recent cpu burst and the history to <EM>predict</EM> the next burst. 
            The <EM>prediction</EM> for the next burst is:<BR>
            <CODE>( AgingRatio * LastBurst ) + ( (1 - AgingRatio) * History )</CODE></LI>
          <LI>Note that the prediction is <EM>not</EM> the real burst. The real 
            burst for all of the algorithms is handled the same way.</LI>
        </UL>
      </LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
</UL>
<H2>Other Details</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Each of the  <U>algorithms should run a loop</U>, with the time increasing 
    by one each time through the loop. The loop ends when there are no more processes 
    to run. 
    <UL>
      <LI>The <U>first thing you should do in the loop</U> is move any arriving 
      processes to the appropriate ready queue, assuming there is room for them.</LI>
      <LI>The <U>second thing you should</U> do is move anyone who is finished 
        waiting from the waiting queue to the ready queue.</LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
  <LI>The processor cannot run any process for a total of ContextSwitchDelay time 
    units after stopping the running process. </LI>
  <LI>If the processor is in the IDLE state (meaning that it is not running a 
    process nor is it in the "context switch" after a process ran), 
    then it is free to start running a process immediately, without any delay.</LI>
  <LI>Display the time and status change of each process. I.e. movement from arrival 
    to ready, from blocked to ready, starting, ending a burst, ending a process. 
    Additional states will be needed for the preemptive algorithms.<BR>
